  scrum master using two-week sprints
- Parsed and loaded decennial census tract shapes, population metrics, and HMDA
  loan applications into Postgres/GIS
- Using an API-first approach, pre-rendered shares as GeoJSON and separated
  statistic and shape endpoints

  infinite exploration without high load times
- Configured and maintained demo server, integrating with Jenkins for
  continuous deployment and Travis for testing
