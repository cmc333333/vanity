summary: An open-source Django app for sharing and voting on ideas
technology:
- Python
- Django
- MySql
- Solr

* Designed & implemented an Idea Scale-like platform for Django on a team of 3
  devs and 2 designers in two weeks
* Utilized Solr's more-like-this API and stop-word configuration to reduce the
  number of duplicate submissions
* Our code was eventually picked up for a bureau-wide rollout of the
  application, saving a great deal of money
