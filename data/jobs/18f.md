impact:
- Launched five new federal software systems and significantly extended six
  more as a full-stack developer on agency engagements.
- Developed core architecture and designed essential infrastructure as
  technical lead on seven engagements; authored documentation to satisfy
  federal "Authority to Operate" requirements.
- Set high expectations for code contribution, focusing on legibility,
  testability, and clean code; our easier-to-maintain, faster-to-update style
  was replicated across 18F.
- Inspired confidence from our agency partners by delivering on technical
  promises, carefully learning the problem space, and communicating
  appropriate information.
- Guided efforts to standardize aspects of 18F's development workflow (e.g.
  language selection, Docker tooling, dependency analysis) making projects
  more consistent and on-boarding simpler.
- Improved our engineers' technique through numerous technical presentations &
  post mortems, hundreds of code reviews, and dozens of one-on-one
  best-practice sessions.
- Filtered an uncountable number of resumes and interviewed nearly 50
  technical candidates, ultimately leading to seven hires joining 18F.

18F is a technology startup within the Federal Government, focused on bridging
the gap between industry best practices and the world of bureaucratic
agencies. We build a mix of shared government platforms, beach-heads for
technological growth, and policy-priority one-offs, focusing on agile
planning, user-centered design, and rapid, open-source development. We're
similar to a private-sector contractor with a major different in incentive; we
ultimately serve the general public. More than half of the employees (myself
included) are 100% remote and almost all have a maximum contract of four years
for ease of hiring and to bring in new ideas.

I began my tenure as a full-stack web developer, working with small teams of
engineers, designers, project managers, and product owners to replace legacy
software and manual processes with easier-to-maintain and more efficient
versions. A bit after a year into this effort, I was promoted to "Backend
Engineering Lead", tasked with improving the technical output of our backend
engineers across a wide variety of projects (in addition to working on a
specific product's team). In the lead role, I conducted technical evaluations,
led engineering-wide discussions, and hosted tech talks. As a project
engineer, I helped architect products, developed core systems, and actively
participated in client relations.
