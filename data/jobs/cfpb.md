The **C**onsumer **F**inancial **P**rotection **B**ureau aims to prevent
banks, lendors, and other financial institutions from taking illegal advantage
of their customers and to give the public tools to protect their financial
well-being. The **T**echnology & **I**nnovation office furthered the agency's
mission by hiring roughly thirty designers and developers for a two-year
Fellowship. We spear-headed both lofty data exploration tools and more
pedestrian intranet wikis, always pushing CFPB's technical bounds. We
developed our tools following agile, user-centered practices, almost always in
the open. While the majority of CFPB's employees were in DC, the T&I fellows
were largely remote, returning to the agency once a quarter to regroup.

My primary role during this fellowship was as a backend web developer, writing
tools to ingest data, APIs & templates to make it usable, and performing the
devops necessary to keep it all running. I worked in small teams of
developers, designers, and project managers to create internal prototypes and
launch applications for the public. Notably, a slight majority of my tenure
focused on a webapp that parsed, structured, and displayed regulation content.
To have the greatest impact in my short term, I also fought hard for
fundamental principles like open source, deploying frequently, and limiting
bureacracy through presentations, discussions, and the occasional manifesto.
