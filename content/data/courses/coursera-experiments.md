- Week 1: Why experiment? We consider experiments that can improve processes in
  your life, and those of the people around you. We explore examples of
  experiments and case studies of what can go wrong in an experiment as well.
  Also: demonstrations of how experiments should be run when changing two
  variables (factorial experiments).
- Week 2: Full factorials in two variables and three variables (also called
  "factors"), including the study of categorical variables.
- Week 3: Using least squares (regression) models to analyze data from factorial
  experiments.
- Week 4: Half fractions and fractional factorials, with real case studies and
  examples. This module is being time-warped over two actual weeks.
- Week 5: Using response surface methods to optimize a system.
- Week 6: Bringing all the prior topics together; in-depth case studies.
