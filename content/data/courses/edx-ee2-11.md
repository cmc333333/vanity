#### An introduction to signals and systems

Signals and systems as seen in everyday life, and in various branches of
engineering and science: electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, thermal,
biomedical signals and systems as examples. Extracting the common essence and
requirements of signal and system analysis from these examples. 

#### Formalizing signals

Energy and power signals, Signal properties: periodicity, absolute
integrability, determinism and stochastic character. Some special signals of
importance: the unit step, the unit impulse, the sinusoid, the complex
exponential, some special time-limited signals; continuous and discrete time
signals, continuous and discrete amplitude signals. 

#### Formalizing systems

System properties: linearity, additivity and homogeneity, shift- invariance,
causality, memory, stability, rationality, realizability.  Examples. 

#### Continuous time and discrete time Linear Shift-Invariant (LSI) systems in detail

The impulse response and step response, convolution, input-output behavior
with aperiodic convergent inputs, cascade, parallel and cascade-parallel
interconnections. Characterization of causality and stability of linear
shift-invariant systems. System representation through differential equations
and difference equations. 

#### Periodic and semi-periodic inputs to an LSI system

The notion of a frequency response and its relation to the impulse response,
Fourier series representation, the Fourier Transform,
Convolution/multiplication and their effect in the frequency domain, magnitude
and phase response, Fourier domain duality.
