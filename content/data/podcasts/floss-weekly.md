FLOSS weekly (one of the This Week in Tech podcasts) runs a very tricky line
between overly geeky (e.g. SE Radio) and overly mainstream (e.g. Science
Friday.) Randal Schwartz, Leo Leporte, and others host this weekly(ish)
podcast, discussing open source projects with their creators as well as recent
open source news. Though everything discussed is free, libre, and/or open
source software, the topics range from very specific libraries (such as the
[Lift Framework](http://twit.tv/floss125)) to the more abstract "open data"
projects (such as [Open Street Map](http://twit.tv/floss81)).  Depending on
who is hosting the podcast, the shows are often split into two variable-length
segments: news and the interview. In general, I've found the news to be the
most relevant portion of the podcast (perhaps because I can't keep up with all
of the FLOSS blogs), but the official topic is often interesting as well. The
episodes are quite long (1+ hr), however, so I suggest that the interview be
skipped if it's on a topic which isn't interesting (or is no longer
relevant...)
