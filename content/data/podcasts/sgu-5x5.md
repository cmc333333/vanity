The crew from the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe return for this brief
(roughly five to ten minute) podcast. From what I understand, this spin-off's
goals include focusing on a single, concentrated topic in a verbally clean
manner with the intent of providing educational material for grade-school
classrooms. Overall, this podcast features almost all of the perks of its
parent, including intelligent explanations, thoughtful criticism, and
lighthearted banter. Unfortunately, it seems the hosts have a bit of trouble
moving from the full SGU podcast to its 1/30th length spawn.  Of the episodes
I have heard, at least, the cast tend to stray off topic and, more
importantly, fail to make their points clearly. With the longer time-span
given to the full podcast, both of these issues are resolved through the
course of a complete conversation, but with this shorter format, I do not
always come away with a solid grasp of the topic. Perhaps this reflects the
need to "settle" deeper into this format, but although I enjoy this as an
extension of the SGU, I cannot recommend it as an educational tool.
