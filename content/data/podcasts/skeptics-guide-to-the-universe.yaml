  Dr. Steve Novella hosts a merry band of science-savvy Skeptical Rogues in a
  weekly discussion of advances in technology, changed in education policy,
  and regressions into stupidity. The hour and a half podcasts are not
  composed of news blurbs, however, as the team's mission largely consists of
  spreading critical thinking skills. While every educator and politician uses
  the terms "critical thinking skills" in his/her rhetoric, the SGU delivers
  at the most basic level. Finding examples of misinformation, skewed results,
  and outright deceit comes easily to the crew, and after spending some time
  listening to their explanations and thought processes you, too, will gain an
  accurate 'bullshit meter.' Aside from discussing recent events, the Skeptics
  generally interview prominent members of the skeptical community, which
  provide novel perspectives regarding how a healthy reality check can be
  integrated into our daily lives. This is also clearly shown throughout the
  podcast, which, although skeptically and rationally rooted, feels much more
  like a casual conversation with interesting individuals. All-in-all, I
  highly recommend the SGU podcast; the crew has managed to produce quality,
  informative entertainment without losing its audience. More importantly,
  this podcast has solidified some of my stances but opened the door to other,
  unexpected-yet-fascinating questions.
