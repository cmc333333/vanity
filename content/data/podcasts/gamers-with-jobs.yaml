  I have grown up with video games. I had a Gameboy by the age of three, I
  finished the Spiderman arcade game when I was eight (at a high expense), and
  I was programming Q-Basic games before eighth grade. In college, I decided
  to take a different path, away from the glamor of the games industry towards
  more non-profit ventures, but I never completely let go of my passion for
  the electronic media. Shawn Andrich and his crew help fill this void by
  recording a weekly, two hour conference call, discussing the latest best
  sellers, trends in game design, and other "gaming goodness." What really
  separates this group from other gaming podcasts (and the reason I stick
  around through comments about titles I never have and never will play) is
  their introspection. They are brought together by their love of this form of
  entertainment, but they all have jobs and obligations. They all have
  interests and passions outside of this particular media and aren't afraid to
  bring these passions to the table. Most impressively, they all think and ask
  questions and actively seek answers, and although most of these questions
  revolve around gaming, many of them deal with living as an adult and acting
  as a member of a community. Though the show is free form, the cast has
  managed to bring some of the most intriguing and well-thought ideas I have
  heard to bear. In any event, if you are interested in games, particularly a
  depth-first approach (such as that found in the articles of *[The
  Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/)*), I strongly recommend this
  podcast if you have the time to spare.
