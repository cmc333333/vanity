  The recently re-branded "Think Services Game Group" certainly has the market
  for game development resources covered. They produce the Game Developer
  Magazine, maintain Gamasutra, a website dedicated to recent industry buzz,
  and run several developer-centric
  [conferences](http://www.tsgamegroup.com/event/index.html) including the
  famous Game Developers Conference. These conferences bring developers from
  all over the world together to learn how to sustain their industry by
  creating more enjoyable games, bringing in new audiences, and so on. One
  might call these meeting a seminar, save that they are attended by
  approximately eighteen thousand individuals. Knowing that these conferences
  contained very useful lectures and question-answer sessions, the "Think
  Services" (formerly CMP) businessmen and women decided to record and release
  much of the conferences in the form of audio files under the label GDC
  Radio. Of course, being business-minded, they realized they could sell these
  files for roughly $5 a file, $100 a 'track', or $500 a conference. They do
  sometimes release a file or two from the collection and place it in a
  podcast feed, which I do recommend, as they tend to be very informative. You
  should not expect much from this feed, however, as "Think Services" only
  releases two or so files a year. . .
