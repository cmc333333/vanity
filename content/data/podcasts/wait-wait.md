National Public Radio provides news and entertainment as a public service
throughout the United States. Their listeners are legion and legendary as
largely left-leaning, information hungry intellectuals (or maybe I am just
projecting), and NPR knows their listeners well. To satisfy their fans, NPR
created a news quiz game-show, hosted by Peter Sagel with moderation (and
prizes) from Carl Kassel (of *Morning Edition* fame). For about an hour each
week, Sagel asks a panel of three notable comedians, journalists, and authors
questions pertaining to some of the strangest and funniest news pieces that
have occurred during the course of the week. Audience participation is
encouraged not only in the form of a live audience at the Chase Auditorium in
downtown Chicago, but also playing along as a call-in contestant in several of
the quiz segments. Each episode also contains a game titled 'Not My Job,' in
which Sagel asks influential people (politicians, authors, actors, etc.) three
questions that have absolutely nothing to do with their body of work. The
whole show is remarkably entertaining and uplifting, so I cannot recommend it
enough, especially if you are a current events junkie such as myself. Who
knows, you might even learn something.
