  When I think of political pundits, I tend to think of two categories. The
  first consists of remarkably outspoken, extremely biased talking heads such
  as Bill O'Reilly or Al Franken, who expect to influence others by yelling
  about how idiotic the other side's ideas are. The second group is composed
  of academics and intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky, who have debates about
  the relative merits of different ideologies, but tend to stay out of
  up-to-the-minute politics. Ken Rudin and Ron Elving fall in to neither of
  these categories; they are social analysts, editors, humorists, but above
  all else, political junkies. This fifteen minute weekly podcast features
  these seasoned veterans and their perspectives on the most recent political
  elections, turmoil, and controversy. In such a short period of time, the
  hosts manage to hit on each of the major events of the week as well as give
  many sometimes-accurate, sometimes-hilarious forecasts for the fate of our
  nation. Though they have both been in their industry for many years, the
  hosts clearly love their environment, tossing political trivia and punny
  one-liners at each other throughout each episode. Further, though I am quite
  biased, I feel that the hosts remain very balanced, covering, scrutinizing,
  and mocking both sides of the aisle and all shades politicians. I cannot
  recommend this podcast highly enough because whether you are dealing with
  relationships, education, ideology, or technology, *It's All Politics*.
