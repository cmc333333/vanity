This set of six podcasts devote a minute to technology, health, space,
environmentalism, psychology, and scientific research. I find these bite-sized
chunks to be just a bit *too* condensed, but given the wide array of topics, I
can't complain. Routinely, the knowledge gleamed from these episodes appears a
few weekly later in the "Skeptics' Guide to the Universe" or NPR's "Wait,
Wait... Don't Tell Me!". More importantly, the episodes help build a more
accurate model about the current state of science -- what's currently possible
and what's decades off.
