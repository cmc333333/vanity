The "Third Coast Audio Festival" has a bit of a misleading title; though they
do put on events, including a [Film*less*
Festival](http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/happenings/filmless-festival),
they also curate a weekly radio show ([Re:
Sound](http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/broadcasts/re-sound)) and their own
podcast. The goal of the Third Coast is to find interesting sound bites and
segments to play for their listeners, where the definition of "interesting"
varies greatly. One week, there will be a story about the role radio has
played in people's lives; another, an odd collection of music created by
altering the noises from children's toys; on the third week, a story about
racism in Townsville, Australia. The documentaries, narratives, and other bits
can be a hit or miss, but I find that listening gives me inspiration and leads
into realms that I haven't explored yet.

The podcast follows one of two formats. It may be an episode of Re:Sound (from
any date), which usually means snippets from multiple locations connected into
a pseudo documentary about some audio-related topic. It may also be some
documentary or podcast that the Third Coast podcast organizers found
particularly novel; these are often about more mature content, such as a
documentary about murder-scene cleaning crews. When they select a podcast, I
often find myself so interested in the topic (or story) that I subscribe to
the other podcast. I've done this with both [Flicker
Man](http://www.theflickerman.com/) and The [Memory
Palace](http://thememorypalace.us/) (both of which will have reviews soon.)
