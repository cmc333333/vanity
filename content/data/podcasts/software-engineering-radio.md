Sometimes you delve deep into a subject, so deep that you begin to wonder if
you are the only person who might find the topic fascinating. Software
Engineering radio verifies that not only are you not alone when reading about
different programming techniques but also that there's enough of an audience
to warrant an entire podcast dedicated to such a study. The team at se-radio
do a good job of finding someone related to a particular
technology/methodology (whether it be Scala, MongoDB, agile, Aspect-Oriented
design, etc.) and then digging deeper into that topic than you might think was
reasonable on a podcast. As such, there will be some topics which either go
completely over your head or which are so uninteresting that you'll want to
skip; luckily these are few and far between, in my opinion. I particularly
enjoy the episodes related to developments in programming languages, such as
the [C++0x](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x). All in all, a great
podcast, assuming you're interested in software engineering.
