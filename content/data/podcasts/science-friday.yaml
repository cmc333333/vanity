  Sometimes, I appreciate when information is distilled a bit so that I may
  understand it; this allows me to grasp the 'gist' without leaving me behind.
  This also, generally, leaves the option to find deeper resources if a topic
  strikes a fancy. Ira Flatow and the rest of the staff on this two hour
  series of weekly podcasts certainly agree, designing a program to make
  "science user-friendly." Unfortunately, I may be a bit too deep in the
  scientific realm to really appreciate such a bare-essentials, mass-audience
  production. NPR manages to bring some of the brightest minds in our time on
  to this podcast, but then manages to waste their time (and ours) by asking
  the experts rudimentary and completely tangential questions. In part, this
  is due to the inquires of listeners (many of which should have been
  screened), and in part, due to the host, who is more often interested in
  scientific 'pop-culture' than the expert's field. Surprisingly, Flatow and
  his staff almost always manage to cover news-pieces which I seemed to have
  glossed over during the week, and the news-makers themselves often appear as
  guests. Although I feel that NPR and its listeners lose some great
  opportunities to gain useful, relevant information by keeping this broadcast
  in its current format, a broad audience gains (rudimentary) scientific
  literacy and therefore, I commend this show for that work. As such, I
  recommend this podcast to those who are interested in scientific endeavors
  but do not wish to devote themselves to its subjects. For those who are very
  deep the scientific culture, this show has some good information, but you
  might best be served with another, deeper series.
