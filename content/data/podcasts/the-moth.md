In many ways, The Moth is a mixture between a stand-up comedian, a poetry
reading, and a diary. Members of the community take the mic for about ten
minutes, describing a true, yet often unbelievable, narrative without notes.
The narrators range from experienced radio talents, such as Garrison Keillor,
and tradition comedians, such as Lewis Black, to firefighters, journalists,
and criminals. The stories they tell might be uplifting, tragic, or humorous,
but they almost always leave you with a deeper sense of humanity, as if you
have learned more about yourself by hearing their tales.  Each week, The Moth
captures one (sometimes two) of the narratives and places the original
recordings into their podcast feed. Though I cannot describe this in much more
specific terms (as it drastically alters from story to story), I can highly
recommend this podcast to everyone as it is both informative and entertaining.
