  Originating in the United Kingdom, the Intelligence Squared organization was
  created to produce and promote "Oxford-style" debates around the world. NPR
  and the Rosenkranz Foundation picked up the franchise, hosting a United
  States-based debate society which generates a new debate each month, on
  average. The "Oxford-style" of debating may be seen as the traditional form,
  which prominently appears in presidential debates. This form focuses on a
  single topic, specifically a statement which can be affirmed or denied, such
  as 'Guns reduce crime.' A second key feature of this debate style is the two
  distinct sides, one arguing for the motion and one against. To motivate the
  presenters, Intelligence Squared provides the third, crucial feature of
  their debates, the audience. Before the debate begins, the hosts poll the
  audience to see which position they take regarding the statement at hand;
  they are polled again at the end of the evening to see which group converted
  the most followers. The audience also plays a critical role in the midst of
  the venture, with a section specifically devoted to answering their
  questions (and accusations). Though not all debates are for everyone, these
  hour-long podcasts bring valid arguments which often slip through the cracks
  when I have already made my decision. Many situations also arise in which I
  believe a particular issue to be very straight-forward but this podcast has
  shown the nuances and complexities at hand. While I do not recommend these
  recordings to the general populous, if you are interested in debate,
  philosophical questions, or learning the arguments of "the opposition,"
  Intelligence Squared US may be for you.
