      <p>Podcasts have been a huge source of information for me since my move to Chicago. They allow me to complete much of the daily grind (travel, cooking dinner, washing dishes, etc.) without feeling that I've wasted much time. My love for podcasts has led to the development of my PHP-based playlist generator, FillMyPod. Below you will find some of my favorite audio content on the web.</p>

                <div class="field-content"><p>FLOSS weekly (one of the This Week in Tech podcasts) runs a very tricky line between overly geeky (e.g. SE Radio) and overly mainstream (e.g. Science Friday.) Randal Schwartz, Leo Leporte, and others host this weekly(ish) podcast, discussing open source projects with their creators as well as recent open source news. Though everything discussed is free, libre, and/or open source software, the topics range from very specific libraries (such as the <a  target='_blank' href="http://twit.tv/floss125">Lift Framework</a>) to the more abstract "open data" projects (such as <a  target='_blank' href="http://twit.tv/floss81">Open Street Map</a>). Depending on who is hosting the podcast, the shows are often split into two variable-length segments: news and the interview. In general, I've found the news to be the most relevant portion of the podcast (perhaps because I can't keep up with all of the FLOSS blogs), but the official topic is often interesting as well. The episodes are quite long (1+ hr), however, so I suggest that the interview be skipped if it's on a topic which isn't interesting (or is no longer relevant...)</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>I have grown up with video games. I had a Gameboy by the age of three, I finished the Spiderman arcade game when I was eight (at a high expense), and I was programming Q-Basic games before eighth grade. In college, I decided to take a different path, away from the glamor of the games industry towards more non-profit ventures, but I never completely let go of my passion for the electronic media. Shawn Andrich and his crew help fill this void by recording a weekly, two hour conference call, discussing the latest best sellers, trends in game design, and other "gaming goodness." What really separates this group from other gaming podcasts (and the reason I stick around through comments about titles I never have and never will play) is their introspection. They are brought together by their love of this form of entertainment, but they all <em>have jobs</em> and obligations. They all have interests and passions outside of this particular media and aren't afraid to bring these passions to the table. Most impressively, they all <em>think</em> and ask questions and actively seek answers, and although most of these questions revolve around gaming, many of them deal with living as an adult and acting as a member of a community. Though the show is free form, the cast has managed to bring some of the most intriguing and well-thought ideas I have heard to bear. In any event, if you are interested in games, particularly a depth-first approach (such as that found in the articles of <em><a  target='_blank' href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/" target="_new">The Escapist</a></em>), I strongly recommend this podcast if you have the time to spare.</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>The recently re-branded "Think Services Game Group" certainly has the market for game development resources covered. They produce the Game Developer Magazine, maintain Gamasutra, a website dedicated to recent industry buzz, and run several developer-centric <a  target='_blank' href="http://www.tsgamegroup.com/event/index.html" target="_blank">conferences</a> including the famous Game Developers Conference. These conferences bring developers from all over the world together to learn how to sustain their industry by creating more enjoyable games, bringing in new audiences, and so on. One might call these meeting a seminar, save that they are attended by approximately eighteen thousand individuals. Knowing that these conferences contained very useful lectures and question-answer sessions, the "Think Services" (formerly CMP) businessmen and women decided to record and release much of the conferences in the form of audio files under the label GDC Radio. Of course, being business-minded, they realized they could sell these files for roughly $5 a file, $100 a 'track', or $500 a conference. They do sometimes release a file or two from the collection and place it in a podcast feed, which I do recommend, as they tend to be very informative. You should not expect much from this feed, however, as "Think Services" only releases two or so files a year. . .</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>Originating in the United Kingdom, the Intelligence Squared organization was created to produce and promote "Oxford-style" debates around the world. NPR and the Rosenkranz Foundation picked up the franchise, hosting a United States-based debate society which generates a new debate each month, on average. The "Oxford-style" of debating may be seen as the traditional form, which prominently appears in presidential debates. This form focuses on a single topic, specifically a statement which can be affirmed or denied, such as 'Guns reduce crime.' A second key feature of this debate style is the two distinct sides, one arguing for the motion and one against. To motivate the presenters, Intelligence Squared provides the third, crucial feature of their debates, the audience. Before the debate begins, the hosts poll the audience to see which position they take regarding the statement at hand; they are polled again at the end of the evening to see which group converted the most followers. The audience also plays a critical role in the midst of the venture, with a section specifically devoted to answering their questions (and accusations). Though not all debates are for everyone, these hour-long podcasts bring valid arguments which often slip through the cracks when I have already made my decision. Many situations also arise in which I believe a particular issue to be very straight-forward but this podcast has shown the nuances and complexities at hand. While I do not recommend these recordings to the general populous, if you are interested in debate, philosophical questions, or learning the arguments of "the opposition," Intelligence Squared US may be for you.</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>When I think of political pundits, I tend to think of two categories. The first consists of remarkably outspoken, extremely biased talking heads such as Bill O'Reilly or Al Franken, who expect to influence others by yelling about how idiotic the other side's ideas are. The second group is composed of academics and intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky, who have debates about the relative merits of different ideologies, but tend to stay out of up-to-the-minute politics. Ken Rudin and Ron Elving fall in to neither of these categories; they are social analysts, editors, humorists, but above all else, political junkies. This fifteen minute weekly podcast features these seasoned veterans and their perspectives on the most recent political elections, turmoil, and controversy. In such a short period of time, the hosts manage to hit on each of the major events of the week as well as give many sometimes-accurate, sometimes-hilarious forecasts for the fate of our nation. Though they have both been in their industry for many years, the hosts clearly love their environment, tossing political trivia and punny one-liners at each other throughout each episode. Further, though I am quite biased, I feel that the hosts remain very balanced, covering, scrutinizing, and mocking both sides of the aisle and all shades politicians. I cannot recommend this podcast highly enough because whether you are dealing with relationships, education, ideology, or technology, <em>It's All Politics</em>.</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>Sometimes, I appreciate when information is distilled a bit so that I may understand it; this allows me to grasp the 'gist' without leaving me behind. This also, generally, leaves the option to find deeper resources if a topic strikes a fancy. Ira Flatow and the rest of the staff on this two hour series of weekly podcasts certainly agree, designing a program to make "science user-friendly." Unfortunately, I may be a bit too deep in the scientific realm to really appreciate such a bare-essentials, mass-audience production. NPR manages to bring some of the brightest minds in our time on to this podcast, but then manages to waste their time (and ours) by asking the experts rudimentary and completely tangential questions. In part, this is due to the inquires of listeners (many of which <em>should</em> have been screened), and in part, due to the host, who is more often interested in scientific 'pop-culture' than the expert's field. Surprisingly, Flatow and his staff almost always manage to cover news-pieces which I seemed to have glossed over during the week, and the news-makers themselves often appear as guests. Although I feel that NPR and its listeners lose some great opportunities to gain useful, relevant information by keeping this broadcast in its current format, a broad audience gains (rudimentary) scientific literacy and therefore, I commend this show for that work. As such, I recommend this podcast to those who are interested in scientific endeavors but do not wish to devote themselves to its subjects. For those who <em>are</em> very deep the scientific culture, this show has some good information, but you might best be served with another, deeper series.</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>The crew from the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe return for this brief (roughly five to ten minute) podcast. From what I understand, this spin-off's goals include focusing on a single, concentrated topic in a verbally clean manner with the intent of providing educational material for grade-school classrooms. Overall, this podcast features almost all of the perks of its parent, including intelligent explanations, thoughtful criticism, and lighthearted banter. Unfortunately, it seems the hosts have a bit of trouble moving from the full SGU podcast to its 1/30th length spawn. Of the episodes I have heard, at least, the cast tend to stray off topic and, more importantly, fail to make their points clearly. With the longer time-span given to the full podcast, both of these issues are resolved through the course of a complete conversation, but with this shorter format, I do not always come away with a solid grasp of the topic. Perhaps this reflects the need to "settle" deeper into this format, but although I enjoy this as an extension of the SGU, I cannot recommend it as an educational tool.</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>Dr. Steve Novella hosts a merry band of science-savvy Skeptical Rogues in a weekly discussion of advances in technology, changed in education policy, and regressions into stupidity. The hour and a half podcasts are not composed of news blurbs, however, as the team's mission largely consists of spreading critical thinking skills. While every educator and politician uses the terms "critical thinking skills" in his/her rhetoric, the SGU delivers at the most basic level. Finding examples of misinformation, skewed results, and outright deceit comes easily to the crew, and after spending some time listening to their explanations and thought processes you, too, will gain an accurate 'bullshit meter.' Aside from discussing recent events, the Skeptics generally interview prominent members of the skeptical community, which provide novel perspectives regarding how a healthy reality check can be integrated into our daily lives. This is also clearly shown throughout the podcast, which, although skeptically and rationally rooted, feels much more like a casual conversation with interesting individuals. All-in-all, I highly recommend the SGU podcast; the crew has managed to produce quality, informative entertainment without losing its audience. More importantly, this podcast has solidified some of my stances but opened the door to other, unexpected-yet-fascinating questions.</p></div>

Software Engineering radio verifies that not only are you not alone when reading about different programming techniques but also that there's enough of an audience to warrant an entire podcast dedicated to such a study. The team at se-radio do a good job of finding someone related to a particular technology/methodology (whether it be Scala, MongoDB, agile, Aspect-Oriented design, etc.) and then digging deeper into that topic than you might think was reasonable on a podcast. As such, there will be some topics which either go completely over your head or which are so uninteresting that you'll want to skip; luckily these are few and far between, in my opinion. I particularly enjoy the episodes related to developments in programming languages, such as the <a  target='_blank' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x">C++0x</a>.

Members of the community take the mic for about ten minutes, describing a true, yet often unbelievable, narrative without notes. The narrators range from experienced radio talents, such as Garrison Keillor, and tradition comedians, such as Lewis Black, to firefighters, journalists, and criminals. The stories they tell might be uplifting, tragic, or humorous, but they almost always leave you with a deeper sense of humanity, as if you have learned more about yourself by hearing their tales. Each week, The Moth captures one (sometimes two) of the narratives and places the original recordings into their podcast feed. Though I cannot describe this in much more specific terms (as it drastically alters from story to story), I can highly recommend this podcast to everyone as it is both informative and entertaining.</p></div>

The goal of the Third Coast is to find interesting sound bites and segments to play for their listeners, where the definition of "interesting" varies greatly. One week, there will be a story about the role radio has played in people's lives; another, an odd collection of music created by altering the noises from children's toys; on the third week, a story about racism in Townsville, Australia. The documentaries, narratives, and other bits can be a hit or miss, but I find that listening gives me inspiration and leads into realms that I haven't explored yet.</p>
<p>The podcast follows one of two formats. It may be an episode of Re:Sound (from any date), which usually means snippets from multiple locations connected into a pseudo documentary about some audio-related topic. It may also be some documentary or podcast that the Third Coast podcast organizers found particularly novel; these are often about more mature content, such as a documentary about murder-scene cleaning crews. When they select a podcast, I often find myself so interested in the topic (or story) that I subscribe to the <em>other</em> podcast. I've done this with both <a  target='_blank' href="http://www.theflickerman.com/">Flicker Man</a> and <a  target='_blank' href="http://thememorypalace.us/">The Memory Palace</a> (both of which will have reviews soon.)</p></div>

                <div class="field-content"><p>National Public Radio provides news and entertainment as a public service throughout the United States. Their listeners are legion and legendary as largely left-leaning, information hungry intellectuals (or maybe I am just projecting), and NPR knows their listeners well. To satisfy their fans, NPR created a news quiz game-show, hosted by Peter Sagel with moderation (and prizes) from Carl Kassel (of <em>Morning Edition</em> fame). For about an hour each week, Sagel asks a panel of three notable comedians, journalists, and authors questions pertaining to some of the strangest and funniest news pieces that have occurred during the course of the week. Audience participation is encouraged not only in the form of a live audience at the Chase Auditorium in downtown Chicago, but also playing along as a call-in contestant in several of the quiz segments. Each episode also contains a game titled 'Not My Job,' in which Sagel asks influential people (politicians, authors, actors, etc.) three questions that have <em>absolutely</em> nothing to do with their body of work. The whole show is remarkably entertaining and uplifting, so I cannot recommend it enough, especially if you are a current events junkie such as myself. Who knows, you might even learn something.</p></div>
