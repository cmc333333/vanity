title: Drupal as a Web Service
---

I gave a [talk](http://2009.drupalcampchicago.org/sessions/drupal-web-service)
at [Drupal Camp Chicago 2009](http://2009.drupalcampchicago.org) discussing
how to connect other applications to your Drupal site by turning it in to a
web service. The talk had pretty good attendance, and I thought someone
recorded it, but I cannot find that anywhere online. Instead, I'm in the
process of converting the talk into an web accessible format which will
hopefully serve as an adequate reference. Until this is complete, please jump
ahead to the [Slides and Example Code](slides-code), which contain the bulk of the information.
