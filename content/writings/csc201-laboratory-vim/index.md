title: "CSC201 Laboratory: ViM"
---

In this lab, we will be working with the versatile open-source editor, ViM.
This program, which is available for all major operating systems is one of the
most powerful editors around, and is specifically designed to make editing
much faster and more efficient. Unfortunately, to achieve this status, ViM has
a bit of a learning curve, especially up front. Once you can master the major
concepts, however, it should be very easy to edit more productively, and to
discover how to become even more proficient over time. To paraphrase the
program's creator, Bram Moolenaar, ViM is designed so that any dull,
repetitive task could be automated with the least amount of effort.
