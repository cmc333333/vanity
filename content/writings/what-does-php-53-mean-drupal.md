title: What Does PHP 5.3 Mean for Drupal?
---

For Drupal Camp Chicago 2010, I presented on PHP 5.3 for Drupal developers. I focused on the new features of the new version, emphasizing how they could be used within a Drupal module. Overall, I think the topic was a bit too dry, but I think that the audience might have learned a thing or two. As soon as the video is online, I'll post that here, but for now, I've embedded the google doc.
