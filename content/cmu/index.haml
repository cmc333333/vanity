  Your generous feedback will strengthen my PhD application to Carnegie Mellon
  and increase my odds of acceptance. I've broken the application into its
  component documents for your review and evaluation below. Please click
  through to the documents (each less than two pages) in Google Docs and use
  the commenting feature there to leave feedback. Alternatively, shoot me an
  %a{href: "mailto:cm.lubinski@gmail"} email.
  Thank you not only for feedback but your support! I have a shot to address
  some of the challenging legal and policy problems we face, and you can help
  me take it.

  CMU's
  %a{href: "http://sc.isri.cmu.edu/"}
    Societal Computing
  PhD program focuses on the intersection of technology, policy, and society.
  They're not as research centric as other parts of CMU, and encourage
  applications from govies and industry folks. They have research into privacy
  policies (including machine-learning based digital assistants and
  machine-readable policy languages), applying network analysis to the social
  media, and the design of smart grids.

%h2 Statement of Purpose
%p
  Absent a specific prompt, I chose a relatively specific research topic and
  explained 1) why it matters, 2) why I'm qualified, and 3) why CMU is the
  place for this research. I tried to stick to around 500 words and aimed to
  weave together my academic, industry, and government experience.

%h2 Resume
%p
  %strong Prompt:
%blockquote
  Outline your education, research experience, work experience, publications,
  scholarships awarded, prizes and honors received, society memberships, and
  extracurricular activities.

%h2 Recommenders
%p
  %strong Prompt:
%blockquote
  Three letters of recommendation are required. At least two should be from
  faculty or recent employers. Recommenders should know you relatively well
  and be able to evaluate the quality of your academic and professional
  abilities.
%p Here's my current plan; is it a good mix?
%ul
  %li My graduate research advisor (and professor) at DePaul
  %li A second research advisor from DePaul
  %li The Director of Engineering (i.e. my second-level boss) at 18F
  %li My frequent project manager at 18F
  %li A previous co-worker and current director of Engineering at CFPB

%hr
%h2 Publications
%p
  Despite having very little in the way of academic publications, I do want to
  emphasize my public speaking experience. As many of those presentations are
  around regulations and parsing them, they seem somewhat applicable.

%h2 Fellowships
%p
  %strong Prompt:
%blockquote
  List only those fellowships which you are applying for or have been awarded
  for your graduate studies.
  Do not list fellowships that were awarded for undergraduate studies.
%p
  Though we applied grants to
  %em fund
  my research, I don't think they qualify. My CFPB Fellowship (really, a job)
  wasn't related to graduate studies.

%hr
%h2 Research Experience
%p
  I used this space as a sort of resume for research experience, listing
  several of the important sub-steps in my forensics research.

%hr
%h2 Industry/Government Experience
%p
  Here I tried to show that many of the qualities which make a good employee
  also prepare one for graduate research. I also emphasized the overlap
  between my intended research topic and my government experience.
